# Project 1 - Address Book Console Application
Goal and Outcomes:

This project will serve you in developing your OOP skills through developing an Address Book Console Application that requires assembling a solution out of modular classes, giving each class a good API for its client(s) and testing. This requires:

    - you to do "Divide and Conquer" a strength of OOP design that lets you use modularity and encapsulation to divide a problem into more than one smaller problem.
    - you to develop Unit Testing Code - taking in part advantage of some Test Driven (maybe we should call it Test Assisted) Design/Implementation.
    - use of Collections in Java to implement Data Structures need.
    - you to efficiently solve some of the problem using algorithms you learned about in Data Structures and Algorithms class. You want to write classes (methods) that run quickly.
    - you to create a single, static AddressBook instance that all other classes and the client code will access. 
    
    In OOP, this is sometimes called a "singleton" pattern, since there is only one instance of the object and the other classes are always given a point to that one instance.
